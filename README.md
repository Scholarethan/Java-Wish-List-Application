#Wishlist Application

## *Ethan's Java Personal Project*

Some of the application's capabilities and functions:
- Users can store or remove items they wish to purchase
- Separate wishlist into different categories
- Search within wishlist for particular items
- Mark items in wishlist as purchased

Who will use this application?
- Anybody looking to **enhance** or **optimize** their online shopping experience

<p>Offering unrivaled selection and unbeatable prices, online shopping has become one of my favourite methods of shopping.
 Whether to compare prices or just to admire products, I often have countless browser tabs open during sale seasons.
 My experience as an avid online shopper has helped me distinguish some good and bad qualities of online shopping. Based upon my experiences,
 I wanted to create an application to streamline the overall experience, amplifying the good and removing the bad.</p>
 Hopefully this project can assist you in your online shopping!

## *Instructions for Grader (Hi Beriwan!!)*

Hi Beriwan, here is the list of instructions for my program:
- you can generate the first required event by **clicking the *add* button**
  on the bottom of the frame, and filling out the following pop ups. 
  An updated wish list will print with your new item added at the end. Please 
  **scroll up** to view the updated wish list!
  
- you can generate the second required event by **clicking the *remove*
  button** on the bottom of the frame, and filling out the following pop ups. Note that 
  I have made the item name and category **case and spelling sensitive**, so please take care 
  when filling out the blanks. An updated wish list will print with your item removed from
  the wish list. Please scroll up to view the updated wish list!

- *(The template doesn't say anything about the other user stories, but I've outlined instructions for them below if you
  need, please refer there if necessary :) )*. Key notes are that the item name and category fields are case and 
  spelling sensitive, and that the update wish list after each command prints at the top of the text box
  so you will have to scroll up to see it! 

- You can locate my *happy* **visual component** by successfully executing any of the commands initiated
  by the buttons on the bottom of the frame. A **success pop up window** will appear with me flashing a thumbs up sign 
  letting you know you're awesome. You can locate my *unhappy* **visual component** by not following
  the instructions prompted by the buttons on the bottom of the frame. When you go off track, an **error message**
  will pop up with my unhappy face.

- You can locate my *happy* **audio component** by successfully executing any of the commands initiated
  by the buttons on the bottom of the frame. A **success pop up window** will appear with a happy sound.
  You can locate my *unhappy* **audio component** by not following the instructions prompted by the buttons on the bottom 
  of the frame. When you go off track, an **error message** will pop up with an alert sound. 

- You can **save** the state of my application by clicking menu on the top left corner of the frame, and **selecting the
 *save* menu option**.

- You can **reload** the state of my application by clicking menu on the top left corner of the frame, and **selecting 
  the *load* menu option**.  

***THANKS BERIWAN :)***

Further info (I wrote this before noticing the mandatory template we have to follow, 
                refer here if you need additional info)

- Upon running my program, you will be greeted with a brand new empty wish list.

- There is a button panel on the bottom of the frame, allowing you to choose commands

- Each of the commands will prompt you to enter in the information fields of an Item.
  Please note that I have made the name and category fields case and spelling sensitive, 
  since it is possible that different items can have the same name etc.

- Add allows you to add a new item to the bottom of the list. Please note that when the updated
  list prints, you will be required to scroll up to the top of the pane where the list gets printed

- Remove allows you to remove an item from the wish list. Again, please remember to scroll up to view
  the updated wish list (this is common for all of the commands!)

- Mark as Purchased and Archive buttons allow you to mark an item as purchased or archived. If you
  do execute these commands, you will see the updated list contains the item, with the corresponding field changed
  from false to true.

- The audiovisual components occur for all of the pop up windows reporting errors or success. 
  When you successfully execute a command, you will hear a nice happy sound, and see a picture of me
  flashing a thumbs up pose to let you know you're awesome. When something goes wrong, you will hear 
  an alerting sound, and you'll see a picture of me looking not so happy on the pop up window.  

- Via the menu button on the top left corner of window, you can load in a saved wish 
    list from file.

- Via the menu button on the top left corner, you can save your wish list to file.
